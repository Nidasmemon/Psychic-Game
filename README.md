# Psychic-Game

This is a guessing game where the computer generates a random letter, and the user must push different keys on their keyboard to try to guess that letter. Each time an incorrect letter is pressed, it is listed on screen for the user to see. The user has nine tries before the game resets and chooses another random letter for them to guess again. Each time the player guesses correctly, the "wins" counter goes up by one, and likewise, each time they go through their nine tries, and still guess incorrectly, the "losses" counter goes up by one. 

Hope you enjoy playing the Psychic Game!
